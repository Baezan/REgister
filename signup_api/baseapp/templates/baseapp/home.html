      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
        knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
        Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research.
        Education frequently
        takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education
        can take place
        in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
        feels, or acts may
        be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.education in zambia </p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many public schools provide a free education through the government.
        Parents may send their own children to a private
        schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because
        their countries do
        not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or
        because the
        children have to work for money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education for
        girls.The city of Alexandria in
        Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
        Greece. There, the
        great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse
        of literacy and
        organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
        knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
        society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed
        knowledge,
        values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
        skills that could
        be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time
        of the Middle
        Kingdom.</p>
